\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{the cool kids are using overleaf these days}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[{\DejaSans âœ“}] edit LaTeX documents in the webbrowser 
    \item[{\DejaSans âœ“}] be collaborative with multiple users editing the same document
    \item[{\DejaSans âœ“}] automatic rebuild and pdf view
    \item[{\DejaSans âœ“}] version control
    \item[{\DejaSans âœ“}] all in the cloud
    \item<2->[{\DejaSans â˜¹}] not much of a choice, manager starts with one tool and the rest has to join
      \newline (when collaborating, you have to agree on something anyway)
    \item<2->[{\DejaSans â˜º}] one of the least disappointing vim binding implementations in a browser I've worked with
    \item<2->[{\DejaSans â˜¹}] all local plugins and settings inaccessible
    \item<2->[{\DejaSans â˜¹}] no command line tools
    \item<3->[{\DejaSans ðŸ˜ƒ}] synchronised \texttt{git} access!
  \end{itemize}

      {\DejaSans âœ“} discussions accessible through \texttt{git}

      {\DejaSans âœ˜} but \dots only really nice in the WYSIWYG view

  \begin{block}{only comments in the correct syntax get rendered}
    It happened to us multiple times that responses written in the source view in the browser were not seen byall users.
  \end{block}

    \vspace{-.6\textheight}
    \begin{alertblock}{That will happen again}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item if someone uses the page with default settings we can hardly blame them
        \item \dots maybe enforce WYSIWYG through non-technical means
      \end{itemize}

    \begin{exampleblock}{But maybe help where the issue is known}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Getting the syntax right is easy for a computer
        \item[$\Rightarrow$] Let the computer do the job
      \end{itemize}

\section{solution}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{I have something for you}
  \begin{block}{what's there}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item code on \myhref{https://github.com/pseyfert/overleaf-commenter}{https://github.com/pseyfert/overleaf-commenter}.
      \item mostly python for printing to the command line
      \item rudimentary vim plugin integration
        \begin{itemize}
          \item insert after cursor
          \item check if discussion already present (yes: reply, no: start)
        \end{itemize}
      \item code under AGPL, copyright with my employer
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{exampleblock}{I'd be happy if this is of use for somebody}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I'll be happy to merge a pull request with emacs integration
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{future developments}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I tried overleaf v2 very early in the test phase
    \item direct \texttt{git} access is gone (only git\emph{hub} export/import)
      \begin{itemize}
        \item but overleaf says they're working on bringing it back
      \end{itemize}
    \item discussions not taking place in tex comments anymore
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[{\DejaSans â˜¹}] \texttt{overleaf-commenter} might become useless
        \item[{\DejaSans ðŸ˜ƒ}] no long term maintenance concerns
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{collaborative work on TeX documents is hard}

  Imagine you want to work with some colleagues on a LaTeX document
  \begin{block}{option 1: set up a git repo}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{git clone/pull}, edit files, \texttt{make}, \texttt{git add}, \texttt{git commit}, \texttt{git push}, tell your colleagues to pull \dots for just fixing a typo???
      \item you don't see the same text when editing it during a skype call about 
        \newline (screen share requires good internet, only one can type)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{option 2: work on the cloud in your browser}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item all your text editor configurations: gone
      \item bad hotel wifi: no work
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
